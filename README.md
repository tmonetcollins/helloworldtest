I'm new to ALL of this. :) 
Alongside being a digital marketer, I enjoy long walks to my bed and candlelit movie nights. 
Hopefully GitHub is the place for me to learn without being bogged down with the vastness of it all. 
*stares off into the distance* The vastness of coding. 
Either way- feel free to say hello here or on Twitter: @tmonetcollins
